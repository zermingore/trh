Human translation / language learning tool (still looking for a relevant name)

lib/sqlite.c lib/sqlite.h come from the SQLite project (https://sqlite.org)


You may want to initialize the DB to get started using ./init_db.sh
A desktop launcher entry can be generated running tools/create_desktop_entry.sh

In order to handle your own DB (vocabulary / grammar)
You can create a file with your own default words / supported languages
db/custom/default_values.sql will be automatically sourced
(You may want to create a local bare git repo to track your custom file)
NOTE: If db/custom/ does not exist, the default DB creation will print a warning



In order to compile, you will need make, cmake and gtk3 with its C++ interface libraries.
Debian package names: build-essential cmake libgtk-3-dev libgtkmm-3.0-dev

To use the DB, you'll need sqlite3


Cross Build:

You may want to make your custom rootfs RFS available
(eventually, with partition offset)
sudo mount -o loop,offset=PARTITION_OFFSET rfs.img mount_point

A complete AARCH-64 example is available:
cmake -DCMAKE_SYSROOT=/path/to/rfs -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../cross_build_aa64 -D PRJ_ROOT=. -B build/ -S src/gtk/ && make -j8
